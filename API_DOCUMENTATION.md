# Data Push APIs

The Data Push APIs are the **recommended method** for integrating external systems like Power Automate, Zapier, or custom applications with the Customer Portal. These APIs allow you to synchronize data using upsert operations (create if new, update if exists).

## Authentication

All Data Push APIs require API key authentication. Include your API key in one of two ways:

**Option 1: X-API-Key Header (Recommended)**
```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

**Option 2: Authorization Bearer Token**
```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Power Automate Configuration

When setting up HTTP requests in Power Automate:

1. **Method**: `POST`
2. **URI**: `https://your-portal.replit.app/api/data/users/upsert`
3. **Headers**:
   - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
   - `X-API-Key`: `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
4. **Body**: Your JSON payload (see examples below)

---

## 1. Users Upsert API

Create or update users in bulk.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/data/users/upsert`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "john.doe@company.com",
      "password": "PlainTextPassword123",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "company": "ABC Corporation",
      "email": "john.doe@company.com",
      "phoneNumber": "+44 7700 900123",
      "isAdmin": false,
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field Requirements:**
- `username` (required): Unique username, typically email
- `password` (required): Can be **plain text** or bcrypt hashed. System automatically detects and hashes plain text passwords before storage
- `name` (required): Full name
- `company` (required): Company name
- `email` (required): Email address (used for linking orders and RMAs)
- `phoneNumber` (optional): Phone number with country code
- `isAdmin` (optional): Boolean, defaults to false
- `isActive` (optional): Boolean, defaults to true. Set to false to deactivate user account (prevents login)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 1,
  "updated": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

**Example cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-portal.replit.app/api/data/users/upsert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "users": [
      {
        "username": "jane.smith@company.com",
        "password": "SecurePassword123!",
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "company": "Tech Corp",
        "email": "jane.smith@company.com",
        "phoneNumber": "+44 7700 900456",
        "isAdmin": false,
        "isActive": true
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**User Activation/Deactivation:**
- Set `isActive: false` to deactivate a user account
- Deactivated users cannot login and will receive the message: "Your account has been deactivated. Please contact your administrator for assistance."
- Set `isActive: true` to reactivate a user account

**Password Handling:**
- Send passwords in **plain text** - the system automatically encrypts them with bcrypt before storage
- The system detects if a password is already hashed (starts with `$2a$` or `$2b$`) and skips re-hashing
- This allows your external system to send plain text passwords without needing bcrypt encryption capability

---

## 2. Orders Upsert API

Create or update orders and automatically link them to users via email. Supports multi-currency and timestamp-based delivery timeline tracking.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/data/orders/upsert`

        "invoiceMailed": "2024-10-15T15:00:00.000Z",
        "sentToWarehouse": "2024-10-16T09:00:00.000Z",
        "dateFulfilled": "2024-10-17T14:00:00.000Z",
        "dispatchDate": "2024-10-19T08:00:00.000Z",
        "orderCompleted": null
      },
      "items": [
        {
          "productName": "Dell Latitude 7420",
          "productDescription": "14-inch FHD, Intel i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD",
          "quantity": 2,
          "unitPrice": 649.99,
          "totalPrice": 1299.98,
          "imageUrl": "https://example.com/laptop.jpg"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field Requirements:**
- `orderNumber` (required): Unique order identifier
- `email` (required): Customer email (must match a user in the system)
- `customerName` (optional): Customer display name
- `orderDate` (required): ISO 8601 date format
- `status` (optional): **Auto-determined from timeline** - Do not include this field. Status is automatically calculated based on timeline milestones
- `currency` (optional): One of: `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`, `AED`. Defaults to `GBP`
- `totalAmount` (required): Decimal number (e.g., 1299.99 for £1,299.99 or $1,299.99)
- `savedAmount` (required): Decimal number (savings vs new price, e.g., 300.50)
- `estimatedDelivery` (optional): ISO 8601 date format
- `trackingNumber` (optional): Shipping tracking number
- `shippingAddress` (optional): Full address object
- `timeline` (optional): Delivery timeline object with timestamp milestones (see below). Status is automatically determined from these dates
- `items` (optional): Array of order items

**Timeline Object (Optional but Recommended):**
The timeline field tracks order progress with timestamps for each milestone based on your actual system dates. **The order status is automatically determined from these dates** - the system checks the timeline in reverse order and sets the status based on the most recent completed milestone.

All fields are optional and use ISO 8601 date format. **Map your system dates to these fields:**

| Timeline Field | Your System Date | Description | Status Triggered |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| `orderDate` | **Order Date** | When the order was placed | `placed` |
| `paymentDate` | **Payment Date** | When payment was received | `processing` |
| `invoiceMailed` | **Date Invoice Mailed** | When invoice was sent to customer | - |
| `sentToWarehouse` | **Sent to Warehouse Date** | When order was sent to warehouse for processing | `in_production` |
| `dateFulfilled` | **Date Fulfilled** | When warehouse completed order preparation | `in_production` |
| `dispatchDate` | **Dispatch Date** | When order was dispatched from warehouse | `shipped` |
| `orderCompleted` | - | When order process was fully completed | `completed` |

**Future Dates (Not Used in Timeline):**
These are planning dates and should NOT be included in the timeline object:
- Expected Shipping Date
- Agreed Delivery Date  
- Payment Due Date

**Status Determination Logic:**
The system automatically determines status by checking timeline milestones in this priority order:
1. If `orderCompleted` has a date → Status is `completed`
2. If `dispatchDate` has a date → Status is `shipped`
3. If `dateFulfilled` has a date → Status is `in_production`
4. If `sentToWarehouse` has a date → Status is `in_production`
5. If `paymentDate` has a date → Status is `processing`
6. If `orderDate` has a date → Status is `placed`
7. If no timeline provided → Status defaults to `placed`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 1,
  "updated": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Users must exist before creating orders (upsert users first)
- Orders are linked to users via the `email` field
- All monetary amounts are decimal numbers (e.g., 1299.99 for £1,299.99 or $1,299.99)
- Currency field determines how amounts are displayed in the portal
- **Status is automatically determined from timeline** - Do not include a `status` field in your request
- Timeline milestones enable gamified delivery tracking visualization
- Dates must be in ISO 8601 format with timezone
- Timeline milestones can be null or omitted for future milestones
- Only include timeline dates for milestones that have actually occurred - the system will determine the current status automatically

## 3. Warranties Bulk Upload API

**⚠️ TRUNCATE AND REPLACE:** This endpoint completely replaces the entire warranties table with your data. It truncates all existing records before inserting new ones. This is designed for complete database synchronization from your authoritative warranty system.

**Use Case:** Designed for bulk warranty data synchronization from your main system (150K+ records supported). Ideal for scheduled daily/weekly syncs from your ERP or warranty management system.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/data/warranties/upsert`

**Authentication:** Required - Use API key in `X-API-Key` header or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`

**✨ NEW: Chunked Upload Support** - For datasets over 10K records, split your upload into multiple batches to avoid request size limits. The system automatically handles truncation on the first batch and appends subsequent batches.

---

### Request Format

### Chunked Upload for Large Datasets (100K+ Records)

**When to Use Chunking:**
- Datasets over 10,000 records
- Getting 413 "Request Entity Too Large" errors
- Want to monitor progress of large uploads
- Need to upload 100K+ records reliably

**How Chunking Works:**
1. Split your data into smaller batches (recommended: 5,000-10,000 records per batch)
2. Send each batch with `batchNumber` and `totalBatches` parameters
3. System truncates table on batch 1, then appends subsequent batches
4. Track progress and handle errors per batch

**Chunked Request Format:**
```json
{
  "batchNumber": 1,
  "totalBatches": 20,
  "warranties": [
    /* 5000 records here */
  ]
}
```

**Batch Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `batchNumber` | Integer/String | Optional | Current batch number (1-indexed) - accepts both numbers and strings | `1` or `"1"` |
| `totalBatches` | Integer/String | Optional | Total number of batches in upload - accepts both numbers and strings | `20` or `"20"` |
| `warranties` | Array | Required | Warranty records for this batch | Array of warranty objects |

**Note**: The API automatically converts string inputs to integers, so Power Automate and similar tools can send these as strings without issues.

**Chunking Rules:**
- ✅ `batchNumber` must be between 1 and `totalBatches`
- ✅ Batch 1 triggers table truncation (deletes all existing data)
- ✅ Batches 2+ append data without truncation
- ✅ Send batches sequentially (1, 2, 3...) to avoid race conditions
- ⚠️ If any batch fails, you must restart from batch 1 (truncate + full upload)

**Example: Uploading 100,000 Records in 20 Batches**

```bash
# Batch 1 (truncates table + inserts first 5000)
curl -X POST https://your-portal.replit.app/api/data/warranties/upsert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "batchNumber": 1,
    "totalBatches": 20,
    "warranties": [ /* records 1-5000 */ ]
  }'

# Batch 2 (appends next 5000 without truncating)
curl -X POST https://your-portal.replit.app/api/data/warranties/upsert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "batchNumber": 2,
    "totalBatches": 20,
    "warranties": [ /* records 5001-10000 */ ]
  }'

# ... continue through batch 20
```

**Chunked Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 4998,
  "updated": 0,
  "batchNumber": 1,
  "totalBatches": 20,
  "isLastBatch": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "serialNumber": "BAD-123",
      "error": "Invalid date format"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response Fields (Chunked Upload):**
- `batchNumber`: Confirms which batch was processed
- `totalBatches`: Total batches in the upload
- `isLastBatch`: `true` when `batchNumber === totalBatches`
- `created`: Number of records inserted in THIS batch
- `errors`: Validation errors for THIS batch only

**Power Automate Chunking Example:**

```
1. Get all warranty records from your system
2. Split into chunks of 5000 using array operations
3. Loop through chunks:
   - Set batchNumber = CurrentIndex + 1
   - Set totalBatches = Total chunk count
   - Send HTTP POST with batch data
   - Check response.success
   - If failed, log error and stop
4. After last batch (isLastBatch: true), confirm total count
```

### Performance Specifications

- **Single Request Capacity**: Up to 50MB request body (approximately 30K-50K records depending on data)
- **Chunked Upload Capacity**: Unlimited - tested with 150,000+ records
- **Recommended Batch Size**: 5,000-10,000 records per batch for chunked uploads
- **Processing**: Records processed in batches of 1,000 internally for optimal performance
- **Strategy**: Complete table replacement - truncate on batch 1, append on subsequent batches
- **Error Handling**: Individual record failures don't stop the batch upload
- **Validation**: Each record validated before insertion
- **Response Time**: ~5-10 seconds per 5,000 record batch

### Important Notes & Best Practices

⚠️ **Critical Behaviors:**
1. **Complete Table Replacement**: Every API call deletes ALL existing warranties before inserting new data
2. **Atomic Operation**: Either all valid records are inserted, or none (database transaction)
3. **No Partial Updates**: You cannot update individual records - you must send the complete dataset

✅ **Best Practices:**
1. **Schedule Regular Syncs**: Set up automated daily/weekly syncs from your source system
2. **Send Complete Dataset**: Always send your entire warranty database, not just changes
3. **Monitor Errors Array**: Check response for validation errors and fix source data
4. **Test with Small Batches First**: Test with 10-100 records before full 150K upload
5. **Use Consistent Date Format**: Ensure all dates are in ISO 8601 format with timezone
6. **Validate Before Upload**: Pre-validate your data to minimize errors

📊 **Auto-Determined Fields:**
The system automatically calculates these fields based on your data:
- **Status**: `active`, `upcoming`, or `expired` (based on current date vs. start/end dates)
- **Days Remaining**: Calculated from current date to end date
- **Never include these in your request** - they're computed in real-time when customers search

🔍 **Customer Search Capability:**
Customers can search warranties using either:
- Serial Number (`serialNumber` field)
- Manufacturer Serial Number (`manufacturerSerialNumber` field)

Both fields are indexed for fast searching even with 150K+ records.

---

### Common Integration Patterns

**1. Daily Full Sync (Recommended)**
```
Schedule: Every day at 2:00 AM
Process: Export all warranties from ERP → Send to API → Verify response
```

**2. Weekly Full Sync**
```
Schedule: Every Sunday at midnight
Process: Full database export → Bulk upload → Error report review
```

**3. On-Demand Sync**
```
Trigger: Manual button click in admin panel
Process: Immediate full sync for urgent updates
```

---

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Invalid date format" errors**
- **Cause**: Dates not in ISO 8601 format
- **Solution**: Convert dates to `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` format
- **Example**: `"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"` ✅ (not `"01/01/2024"` ❌)

**Issue: "413 Request Entity Too Large" error**
- **Cause**: Payload exceeds 50MB limit (typically 30K+ records)
- **Solution**: Use chunked upload - split data into batches of 5,000-10,000 records
- **Example**: For 100K records, use 20 batches of 5K each with `batchNumber` and `totalBatches` parameters

**Issue: Upload times out or fails**
- **Cause**: Too many records or network issues
- **Solution**: Use chunked upload to send data in smaller batches

**Issue: Some records missing after upload**
- **Cause**: Validation errors in source data OR incomplete chunked upload
- **Solution**: Check `errors` array in each batch response and fix source data. If using chunked upload, verify all batches completed successfully

**Issue: Old warranties still showing**
- **Cause**: Upload may have failed silently OR batch 1 didn't execute (truncation didn't happen)
- **Solution**: Check response status for all batches. If using chunked upload, confirm batch 1 completed successfully (it truncates the table)

---

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Start Small**: Test with 5-10 records first
2. **Verify Truncation**: Confirm old data is removed
3. **Check Errors**: Review `errors` array in response
4. **Test Search**: Verify customers can find warranties by both serial numbers
5. **Monitor Performance**: Time the upload and monitor server response

## 4. RMAs Upsert API

Create or update Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) requests with multiple serial numbers per RMA.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/data/rmas/upsert`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "rmas": [
    {
      "rmaNumber": "RMA-2024-001",
      "email": "john.doe@company.com",
      "status": "requested",
      "serials": [
        {
          "SerialNumber": "PF1Q4524",

- Users must exist before creating RMAs
- Each RMA can contain multiple serial numbers/devices
- All serials in an RMA are tracked independently with their own status and solution
- RMAs are linked to users via the `email` field
- Field names for serials use PascalCase to match external system conventions

## 5. Order Documents Upsert API

Attach document files to orders (credit notes, packing lists, hashcodes, invoices). Documents are referenced by URL and automatically linked to orders by order number.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/data/documents/upsert`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "orderNumber": "ORD-2024-12345",
      "documentType": "invoice",
      "fileName": "ORD-2024-12345-invoice.pdf",
      "fileUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/invoices/ORD-2024-12345.pdf",
      "fileSize": 245680,
      "mimeType": "application/pdf"
    },
    {
      "orderNumber": "ORD-2024-12345",
      "documentType": "packing_list",
      "fileName": "ORD-2024-12345-packing.xlsx",
      "fileUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/packing/ORD-2024-12345.xlsx",
      "fileSize": 18432,
      "mimeType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"
    },
    {
      "orderNumber": "ORD-2024-12345",
      "documentType": "credit_note",
      "fileName": "ORD-2024-12345-credit.pdf",
      "fileUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/credits/ORD-2024-12345.pdf",
      "fileSize": 152340,
      "mimeType": "application/pdf"
    },
    {
      "orderNumber": "ORD-2024-12345",
      "documentType": "hashcodes",
      "fileName": "ORD-2024-12345-hashcodes.csv",
      "fileUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/hashcodes/ORD-2024-12345.csv",
      "fileSize": 8192,
      "mimeType": "text/csv"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field Requirements:**
- `orderNumber` (required): Order number to attach document to (must exist in orders table)
- `documentType` (required): One of: `credit_note`, `packing_list`, `hashcodes`, `invoice`
- `fileName` (required): Original filename for display purposes
- `fileUrl` (required): Public URL where the file is hosted
- `fileSize` (optional): File size in bytes
- `mimeType` (optional): MIME type for the file

**Valid Document Types:**
- `credit_note` - Credit note PDF documents
- `packing_list` - Packing list Excel/CSV files
- `hashcodes` - Hash verification CSV files
- `invoice` - Invoice PDF documents

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 3,
  "updated": 1,
  "errors": []
}
```

**Upsert Behavior:**
- If a document of the same type already exists for an order, it will be **updated** (replaced)
- If the document type doesn't exist for that order, it will be **created**
- This allows you to push updated documents without creating duplicates

**Example cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-portal.replit.app/api/data/documents/upsert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "documents": [
      {
        "orderNumber": "ORD-2024-12345",
        "documentType": "invoice",
        "fileName": "ORD-2024-12345-invoice.pdf",
        "fileUrl": "https://yourstorage.com/invoices/ORD-2024-12345.pdf",
        "fileSize": 245680,
        "mimeType": "application/pdf"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Important Notes:**
- Orders must exist before attaching documents (create orders via Orders Upsert API first)
- Document files must be hosted on an accessible URL (your own storage, cloud provider, etc.)
- URLs must be publicly accessible or use signed URLs with appropriate expiration
- Each order can have one document of each type (invoice, credit note, packing list, hashcodes)
- Pushing the same document type again will replace the existing document
- Customers can download these documents from their order details page

**Common Use Case - Power Automate:**
```
1. When a new invoice is generated in your ERP system
2. Upload the PDF to your cloud storage (OneDrive, SharePoint, Azure Blob, etc.)
3. Get the public/shared URL for the file
4. Push the document metadata to the portal via this API
5. Customer sees the invoice in their order details automatically
```

## Error Handling

All Data Push APIs return detailed error information:

**Partial Success Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 2,
  "updated": 1,
  "errors": [
    {
      "orderNumber": "ORD-FAIL-001",
      "error": "User with email customer@example.com not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Complete Failure Example:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Request must include 'users' array"
}
```

**Authentication Failure:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "API key required. Provide it in X-API-Key header or Authorization: Bearer <key>"
}
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **User Creation First**: Always upsert users before orders/RMAs to ensure email linking works
2. **Batch Size**: 
   - Users/Orders/RMAs: Keep batches under 500 records per request for optimal performance
   - Warranties: Supports 150K+ records in a single request with automatic batch processing
3. **Error Handling**: Always check the `errors` array and retry failed records
4. **Date Formats**: Use ISO 8601 format: `2024-10-29T10:30:00.000Z`
5. **Password Security**: Send passwords in plain text - the system automatically encrypts them with bcrypt before storage
6. **User Activation**: Use `isActive: false` to deactivate user accounts and prevent login
7. **Monetary Values**: Use decimal numbers (e.g., 1299.99 for £1,299.99 or $1,299.99)
8. **Idempotency**: Upsert operations are safe to retry - they won't create duplicates
9. **Warranty Sync**: The warranties endpoint uses truncate-and-replace strategy - send your complete dataset each time

---

---

## Update Total Units Deployed

Update the total number of remanufactured units deployed. This endpoint automatically recalculates all dependent metrics (carbon saved, water saved, families helped) based on sustainability settings.

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/admin/organizational-metrics/:metricKey`

**Authentication:** Admin session OR API key (both supported)

**URL Parameters:**
- `metricKey`: The metric to update (e.g., `total_units_deployed`)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "value": 75000
}
```

**Example Request (API Key - Recommended for automation):**
```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-portal.replit.app/api/admin/organizational-metrics/total_units_deployed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "value": 75000
  }'
```

**Example Request (Admin Session):**
```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-portal.replit.app/api/admin/organizational-metrics/total_units_deployed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{
    "value": 75000
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "metricKey": "total_units_deployed",
  "metricValue": "75000",
  "lastUpdatedBy": 1,
  "updatedAt": "2024-11-06T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## Automatic Recalculation Logic

When you update `total_units_deployed`, the system automatically:

1. **Fetches sustainability settings** from the database (per-laptop metrics)
2. **Calculates derived metrics:**
   - Total Carbon Saved = Total Units × Carbon per Laptop (default: 316,000g)
   - Total Water Saved = Total Units × Water per Laptop (default: 190,000L)
   - Total Families Helped = Total Units × Families per Laptop (default: 1)
3. **Updates all dependent metrics** in the database
4. **Logs the recalculation** for audit purposes

**Example:**
```
Admin updates total_units_deployed to 75,000 units
  ↓
System fetches sustainability_metrics from system_settings
  ↓
Calculates:
  - Carbon: 75,000 × 316kg = 23,700,000kg CO₂ saved
  - Water: 75,000 × 190,000L = 14,250,000,000L saved
  - Families: 75,000 × 1 = 75,000 families helped
  ↓
Updates all metrics in organizational_metrics table
  ↓
ESG report displays updated values
```

---

## Configuring Sustainability Settings

The per-laptop sustainability metrics are stored in the `system_settings` table with key `sustainability_metrics`. To update these values:

**Default Values (if not configured):**
```json
{
  "carbonReductionPerLaptop": 316000,  // grams (316kg)
  "waterSavedPerLaptop": 190000,       // liters
  "familiesHelpedPerLaptop": 1
}
```

**To update sustainability settings**, modify the `system_settings` table through the database or create an admin endpoint:
```sql
UPDATE system_settings 
SET setting_value = '{"carbonReductionPerLaptop": 320000, "waterSavedPerLaptop": 200000, "familiesHelpedPerLaptop": 1}'
WHERE setting_key = 'sustainability_metrics';
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Update Regularly**: Schedule periodic updates to `total_units_deployed` to keep metrics current
2. **Only Update Total Units**: Don't manually update derived metrics (carbon, water, families) - they recalculate automatically
3. **Verify Settings**: Ensure sustainability_metrics settings exist before updating total units
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check server logs for recalculation confirmations
5. **ESG Report**: View the ESG Report to verify updated metrics are displayed correctly

---

## Error Handling

**Missing Sustainability Settings:**
If sustainability settings are not found, the recalculation aborts with a warning:
```
⚠️ Sustainability metrics settings not found, cannot recalculate organizational metrics
```

**Solution:** Ensure `sustainability_metrics` exists in `system_settings` table with proper values.

**Unauthorized Access:**
```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```
**Solution:** Login as an admin user before making requests.

---

## Integration Example: Scheduled Update

**Scenario:** Update total units deployed every day at midnight with data from your ERP system.

**Power Automate Flow:**
```
1. Scheduled trigger: Daily at 00:00
2. HTTP Request to your ERP: GET total deployed units
3. HTTP Request to Portal: PUT /api/admin/organizational-metrics/total_units_deployed
   - Method: PUT
   - Headers:
     - Content-Type: application/json
     - X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   - Body: {"value": <ERP_TOTAL>}
4. Check response status
5. Send notification on success/failure
```

**Power Automate HTTP Action Configuration:**
```json
{
  "method": "PUT",
  "uri": "https://your-portal.replit.app/api/admin/organizational-metrics/total_units_deployed",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  },
  "body": {
    "value": 75000
  }
}
```

**Node.js Script Example:**
```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function updateOrganizationalMetrics(totalUnits) {
  // Update total units deployed using API key
  const updateRes = await fetch(
    'https://your-portal.replit.app/api/admin/organizational-metrics/total_units_deployed',
    {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-API-Key': process.env.PORTAL_API_KEY // Store API key in environment variable
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ value: totalUnits })
    }
  );
  
  if (!updateRes.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to update metrics: ${updateRes.statusText}`);
  }
  
  const result = await updateRes.json();
  console.log('✅ Updated organizational metrics:', result);
  console.log(`📊 Total units deployed: ${result.metricValue}`);
  
  return result;
}

// Example usage
updateOrganizationalMetrics(75000)
  .then(() => console.log('Update complete'))
  .catch(error => console.error('Update failed:', error));
```

**Python Script Example:**
```python
import requests
import os

def update_organizational_metrics(total_units):
    """Update total units deployed using API key"""
    
    url = 'https://your-portal.replit.app/api/admin/organizational-metrics/total_units_deployed'
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-API-Key': os.environ.get('PORTAL_API_KEY')  # Store API key in environment variable
    }
    payload = {'value': total_units}
    
    response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    result = response.json()
    print(f"✅ Updated organizational metrics: {result}")
    print(f"📊 Total units deployed: {result['metricValue']}")
    
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    update_organizational_metrics(75000)
    print('Update complete')
```

# Use CRUD endpoint
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:5000/api/crud/users"
```

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key required" error:**
- Ensure you're including the API key in the `X-API-Key` header or `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Verify the key hasn't been revoked

**"User with email X not found" error:**
- Create users first before creating orders or RMAs
- Ensure the email matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**RMA with missing serials:**
- Each RMA must include at least one serial item in the `serials` array
- All required serial fields must be provided: SerialNumber, ErrorDescription, ReasonForReturn, ProductDetails

**Date parsing errors:**
- Use ISO 8601 format: `2024-10-29T10:30:00.000Z`
- Include the `T` separator and `Z` timezone

**Monetary value errors:**
- Use decimal numbers for prices and amounts (e.g., 1299.99, not 129999)
- Values represent the actual amount in the currency (£1,299.99 or $1,299.99)

### Rate Limiting

Currently no rate limits are enforced, but we recommend:
- Maximum 100 requests per minute
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Use batch operations where possible
