Build a cinematic, gamified “Order Journey” web experience that visualizes the progress of a customer’s laptop order.
It should blend eco-sustainability, luxury, and futuristic design, giving users a sense of excitement and purpose every time they track their order.

🎯 Core Concept

Create a next-generation order tracker — not a plain timeline.
It should look like a mission dashboard where each stage represents part of the device’s rebirth journey (since this is for a remanufactured laptop company).
Each milestone feels like a level unlocked or mission complete moment.
Each key is a milestone. If the date for a timeline stage is null, that stage is pending.

🪄 What to Build

A futuristic, eco-themed timeline showing the order’s journey from placement to delivery.

Each stage should have a distinct 3D or Lottie-style animation, matching these ideas:
Order Placed: glowing digital “purchase confirmed” animation
Payment Confirmed: floating credit card or energy pulse
Invoice Sent: elegant paper plane or holographic envelope
Sent to Warehouse: robotic arm lifting a green glowing box
Fulfilled: animation of a laptop powering on with green aura (symbolizing renewal)
Dispatched: drone or sleek electric truck zooming off
Delivered: box opens with light rays, nature leaves float out 🌿

Stages should unlock sequentially with smooth transitions and a sense of motion (like a mission progress path).
The current stage should pulse or glow softly, as if “alive.”
Add eco-luxury visuals — clean gradients (emerald, teal, silver), subtle particle glows, elegant typography.
Include sound feedback (soft chime or hum when stage updates).

💎 Key Features

Gamified Progress: progress bar that fills dynamically, milestone counters, and optional “Boost” button that triggers a visual acceleration (e.g., energy beam or fast-forward animation).
Futuristic Mission UI: minimal but cinematic — curved panels, neon accents, maybe light motion blur.
Eco-Luxury Theme: glowing green and silver palette, smooth shadows, glassmorphism UI elements, micro-interactions.

Reward at End: When “Delivered,” show a reward animation like: (please note that the sustainable calculations come from db)
“🌱 Congratulations! You’ve completed your Eco Mission — You saved 2.3kg of e-waste.”
(include a subtle particle burst or confetti animation)

🪶 Tone & Feel

Think: “Tesla app + eco mission dashboard + game level progression.”
The interface should feel premium, calm, and futuristic — not cartoonish.
Use subtle glow, depth, and cinematic motion to make each stage feel meaningful.

💬 Interaction Enhancers

Add a “Track Mission” button to replay the journey.
Add a progress arc or pathway that visually lights up as stages complete.
Add hover effects or tap reveals for more info about each stage (e.g., “Your device is being tested for quality assurance”).
Include a real-time countdown to estimated delivery.

🪩 Deliverable

Dynamic rendering of the stages the timeline dates in db
High-quality animated visuals for each stage
Fully styled eco-luxury futuristic UI
Subtle sound and motion feedback
One-button simulation to show the full progression for demo

Use animated SVGs or Lottie animations to make the timeline feel cinematic.
Incorporate subtle particle backgrounds to suggest energy and renewal.
Make each stage transition look like a mini movie scene.
