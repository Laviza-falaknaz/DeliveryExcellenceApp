Build a high-end, cinematic, gamified order timeline in React that dynamically reads live order data from the database. The timeline should follow this fixed sequence:

Order Confirmed → Sent to Warehouse → Dispatched → Invoice Sent → Payment Confirmed → Fulfilled

1️⃣ Cinematic Stage Animations (Exact Motion & Effects)

Order Confirmed

Animation: glowing purchase button clicks, sparks flying outward

Motion: small pulse with scale bounce, glow intensity ramps up over 0.5s

Particle effect: subtle green spark bursts around the icon

Sent to Warehouse

Animation: eco-green crate moves along a conveyor, robotic arm lifts it

Motion: smooth left-to-right translation, ease-in-out, slight bounce at end

Particle effect: light trail of energy behind the crate

Dispatched

Animation: sleek electric truck/drone zooms along a curved path

Motion: acceleration curve, small camera-like shake when leaving hub

Particle effect: glowing exhaust or energy trail

Invoice Sent

Animation: holographic envelope flies in from side, opens to reveal glowing document

Motion: smooth arc, slight rotation

Particle effect: soft light burst when envelope opens

Payment Confirmed

Animation: floating credit card flips, glows, and pulses

Motion: flip animation along Y-axis, pulse scale ±10%

Particle effect: small floating particles around card

Fulfilled

Animation: laptop powers on, green aura spreads, holographic light rays

Motion: subtle zoom-in + glow ramp, micro particle bursts

End-stage effect: leaves or sparkles float outward (eco-luxury effect)

2️⃣ Stage Status & Transitions

Current Stage: glowing, gently pulsing, with subtle bounce

Completed Stages: solid emerald green with checkmark animation

Pending Stages: dim gray with subtle glow

Transitions between stages: sequential fade + slide + particle flow

Timing: each stage animation duration: 1–1.5s, sequential delay 0.2–0.3s for cinematic pacing

3️⃣ Visual Style & UI

Theme: eco-luxury + futuristic (emerald green, silver, black, soft neon accents)

Typography: sleek sans-serif, modern, minimal, premium feel

Background: animated gradient or particle flow, subtle moving particles for depth

UI elements: glassmorphism panels, soft shadows, glowing borders

Micro-interactions: hover or tap reveals info about each stage (e.g., “Your laptop is being tested for quality assurance”)

Boost Button: optional “Boost Delivery” → accelerates animations + adds energy trail

4️⃣ Gamification & Feedback

Sound cues: soft chime, spark, or whoosh per stage completion

Progress Path: curved or vertical path that lights up dynamically as stages complete

End Screen: “🎉 Delivered! Eco-mission complete — your order is ready 🌱”

Celebration animation: particle burst, leaves, sparkles, glowing halo

5️⃣ Animation & Motion Details

Smooth easing: ease-in-out for all stage transitions

Glow intensity ramps: completed stage (0 → 100%), current stage pulse ±20% intensity

Particle density: subtle for micro-feedback, dense for milestone completion

Sequential animations: no overlapping except particle trails

Optional camera-like motion: slight zoom or pan on the current stage to create “mission cinematic” feel

6️⃣ Tech Stack

React (functional components)

TailwindCSS

Framer Motion or GSAP for all animations

Optional: Lottie JSON for high-quality effects

Fully responsive: mobile + desktop

7️⃣ Deliverable

Ready-to-run React app

Dynamically reads live order data from DB

Implements full cinematic stage animations, particle effects, glow, motion, and sequential storytelling

Looks eco-luxury, futuristic, gamified, and premium

Provides wow factor every time a user checks their order
